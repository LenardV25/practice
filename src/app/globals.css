  Explicitly setting html and body height to 100% is crucial for
  min-h-screen (or h-screen) Tailwind classes to work correctly,
  allowing elements to take up the full viewport height.
  While Tailwind's Preflight usually handles this,
  it's good practice to ensure it, especially if Preflight is
  not fully configured or if other styles interfere.
